## House 2D

House that moves with mouse cursor, drawn from a collection of points using PShape

* The original star shape code is included, and a modified Processing.js compatible version
* I modified the original house code to work with Javascript, this can be seen here: [Processing.js Version](http://www.joeaoregan.ie/Processing/processing.html#lab4)

## Bridge 2D

Bridge that moves with cursor, created in Processing
* I modified the original version to work with Javascript
* I added a version that works with points instead of PShape
* The points version was then modified to work with Processing.js online
* The working JavaScript version can be seen here: [Processing.js Version](http://www.joeaoregan.ie/Processing/processing.html#lab4)
