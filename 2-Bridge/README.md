# Yr2-Graphics---Bridge

Bridge that moves with cursor, created in Processing

- I modified the original version to work with Javascript
- I added a version that works with points instead of PShape
- The points version was then modified to work with Processing.js online
- The working JavaScript version can be seen here: [Processing.js Version](http://www.joeaoregan.ie/Processing/processing.html#lab4)
